# CoastCams
CoastCams is an open-source collection of existing MATLAB scripts to quantify key wave parameters (e.g., wave height, wave period), mean water levels, and morphology (e.g., shoreline positions) in the nearshore environment. The repository performs the analysis on oblique orthorectified timestack images from land-based coastal monitoring systems. The proposed approach is a combination of several key parameters that aims to get a better understanding of nearshore processes by leveraging the strength of existing codes. CoastCams provides a unified and simplified method that is accessible for coastal managers, engineers, and scientists with a user-friendly and practical method to monitor and identify key drivers in coastal zone. In this paper, we present the standalone remote video-based method and validate the estimated hydro parameters with sensors deployed in the nearshore on a rocky platform in Socoa, France. 

## Usage
CoastCams builds upon the foundation laid by [CIRN](https://github.com/Coastal-Imaging-Research-Network), while expanding on the capabilities by making the codes accessible to estimate nearshore processes, mean water levels, and morpholigcal changes in a unified and simplified manner that is accessible to a wide range of uers, i.e., from experts to novices. More information can be found [in this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136481522300186X). 

The input of CoastCams are georectified timestack images from coastal video cameras. The creation of timestack images and georectification can be achieved with the [Quantitative Coastal Imaging Toolbox](https://github.com/Coastal-Imaging-Research-Network/CIRN-Quantitative-Coastal-Imaging-Toolbox).
