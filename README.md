# CoastCams
CoastCams is an open-source collection of existing MATLAB scripts to quantify key wave parameters (e.g., wave height, wave period), mean water levels, and morphology (e.g., shoreline positions) in the nearshore environment. The repository performs the analysis on oblique orthorectified timestack images from land-based coastal monitoring systems. The proposed approach is a combination of several key parameters that aims to get a better understanding of nearshore processes by leveraging the strength of existing codes. CoastCams provides a unified and simplified method that is accessible for coastal managers, engineers, and scientists with a user-friendly and practical method to monitor and identify key drivers in coastal zone. In this paper, we present the standalone remote video-based method and validate the estimated hydro parameters with sensors deployed in the nearshore on a rocky platform in Socoa, France.
